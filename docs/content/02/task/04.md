# 🧑‍💼

What is their (open source) [business model](https://digital-sustainability.github.io/module-eoss-ospo101/module2/#what-are-the-major-open-source-business-models)? Also consider additional [motivations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_models_for_open-source_software) and explain the (different) model(s) used.

If **not, focus on the "consumption** / use / contribute" aspect: Where do they contribute (use)? [Explain reasons](https://digital-sustainability.github.io/module-eoss-ospo101/module1/#section-reasons-to-use-open-source) behind their contributions.
